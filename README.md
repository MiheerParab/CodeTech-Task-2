üìß Text Classification and Spam Mail Detection


üìù Project Overview
This project focuses on building a text classification system to detect spam emails using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model and Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to preprocess email data, extract meaningful features, and classify messages into "spam" or "not spam" categories with high accuracy.

üìÇ Dataset Information
Dataset Used: SpamAssassin Public Dataset
Description: The dataset consists of labeled email messages categorized as "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
Key Columns:
Email Text: Raw email content.
Label: Indicates whether the email is "spam" (1) or "ham" (0).
üîß Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspect data structure and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean text data:
Remove punctuation, special characters, and extra spaces.
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove stopwords using NLTK.
Apply stemming or lemmatization for normalization.
Handle missing values if any.
3. Feature Extraction
Use the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to convert text data into numerical format.
Transform the text data into a sparse matrix using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn.
4. Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Naive Bayes classifier:
MultinomialNB: Best suited for text data.
Evaluate the model on the test data.
5. Model Evaluation
Metrics used:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Confusion Matrix
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Text Preprocessing: NLTK, re
Feature Extraction: scikit-learn
Model Building: Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
The model successfully detects spam emails with high performance, showcasing the effectiveness of BoW and Naive Bayes for text classification.
